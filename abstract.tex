\chapter*{Abstract}
This work aims to create a system aimed at the management and control over electrical expenses in a residence through monitoring, using the concept of IoT. The proposed system monitors in real time the energy consumption in a home, as well as controls sockets and lamps, using information from current sensors. For this, the nodeMCU microcontroller is used to connect to the internet and use the IoT concept.
